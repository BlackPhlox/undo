//! Provides undo-redo functionality with dynamic dispatch and automatic command merging.
//!
//! # Contents
//!
//! * [Record] provides a stack based undo-redo functionality.
//! * [History] provides a tree based undo-redo functionality that allows you to jump between different branches.
//! * [Queue] wraps a [Record] or [History] and provides batch queue functionality.
//! * [Checkpoint] wraps a [Record] or [History] and provides checkpoint functionality.
//! * Commands can be merged using the [merge!] macro or the [merge] method.
//!   When two commands are merged, undoing and redoing them are done in a single step.
//! * Configurable display formatting is provided when the `display` feature is enabled.
//! * Time stamps and time travel is provided when the `chrono` feature is enabled.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Add this to `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! undo = "0.30"
//! ```
//!
//! And this to `main.rs`:
//!
//! ```
//! use undo::{Command, Record};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct Add(char);
//!
//! impl Command<String> for Add {
//!     fn apply(&mut self, s: &mut String) -> undo::Result {
//!         s.push(self.0);
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     fn undo(&mut self, s: &mut String) -> undo::Result {
//!         self.0 = s.pop().ok_or("`s` is empty")?;
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }

//!     let mut record = Record::default();
